**Category:** Standing, Foundation

![Mountain Pose (Tadasana) - Standing straight with arms at sides](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/01-mountain-pose.png)

Mountain Pose might look like "just standing," but it's the foundation for all standing poses. This is where you learn to find your center and establish proper alignment.

### How to Practice

1. Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart, whichever feels more stable
2. Distribute your weight evenly across all four corners of each foot
3. Engage your thighs slightly, lifting your kneecaps without locking
4. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor
5. Roll your shoulders back and down, away from your ears
6. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides, palms facing forward or toward your thighs
7. Lengthen through the crown of your head as if a string is pulling you upward
8. Soften your jaw, relax your face, breathe naturally

### Alignment Checkpoints

- Ears over shoulders
- Shoulders over hips
- Hips over ankles
- Neutral spine (natural curves maintained)
- Weight balanced front-to-back and side-to-side

**Category:** Tabletop, Spinal Flexion

![Cat Pose (Marjaryasana) - On hands and knees with spine rounded upward](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/02-cat-pose.png)

Cat Pose pairs with Cow Pose to create a gentle spinal warm-up. This flexion movement releases tension in the back and neck.

### How to Practice

1. Come to hands and knees, wrists under shoulders, knees under hips
2. Spread your fingers wide, press evenly through your palms
3. As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling
4. Tuck your tailbone under, drawing your pubic bone forward
5. Let your head drop naturally, gaze toward your navel

7. Imagine you're a cat arching its back

- Wrists directly below shoulders

- Spine in full flexion (rounded upward)
- Head relaxed, not forced down
- Equal weight in both hands and both knees

---

**Category:** Tabletop, Spinal Extension

![Cow Pose (Bitilasana) - On hands and knees with belly dropped and chest lifted](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/03-cow-pose.png)

Cow Pose is the counterpart to Cat Pose. Together, they create a flowing movement that warms up the entire spine.

### How to Practice

1. From your tabletop position, as you inhale, drop your belly toward the mat
2. Lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling
3. Let your belly release and soften
4. Draw your shoulders back, away from your ears
5. Lift your gaze gently, looking forward or slightly up
6. Keep your neck as a natural extension of your spine—don't crunch it
7. Feel the stretch across your chest and the front of your torso

### Alignment Checkpoints

- Wrists still under shoulders
- Knees still under hips
- Spine in extension (belly dropping, chest lifting)
- Shoulders drawing back (not hunching)

**Category:** Resting, Forward Fold

![Child's Pose (Balasana) - Kneeling with forehead on mat and arms extended](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/04-childs-pose.png)

Child's Pose is your home base—a restful position you can return to whenever you need a break. It gently stretches the back while calming the nervous system.

### How to Practice

1. From hands and knees, bring your big toes together and widen your knees
2. Sink your hips back toward your heels
3. Walk your hands forward, lowering your chest toward the mat

## Sequencing Principles

When you practice, remember these principles:

1. **Start gently:** Begin with centering and gentle warm-ups
2. **Build heat progressively:** Move from gentle to more demanding poses
3. **Balance the body:** Follow forward folds with gentle backbends, balance right and left sides
4. **Include transitions:** Use Downward Dog, Child's Pose, and Mountain as transitions
5. **Wind down gradually:** Move from active poses to passive ones before final relaxation
6. **Always end with Savasana:** Allow at least 5 minutes for integration

---

## Accessibility and Modifications

Yoga is for every body. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Use props freely:** Blocks, straps, and blankets aren't cheating—they're tools
- **Listen to your body:** Sharp pain is a signal to back off
- **Breath is your guide:** If you can't breathe smoothly, ease up
- **Modify without shame:** Every body is different

### Common Contraindications

- **Lower back issues:** Be cautious with forward folds and backbends
- **Knee problems:** Avoid deep knee bends, use padding
- **Neck injuries:** Skip headstand variations, be careful in shoulder stand
- **Pregnancy:** Many poses need modification—consult a prenatal yoga teacher
- **High blood pressure:** Avoid inversions and breath retention

---

## Starting Your Practice

You don't need fancy equipment or a dedicated studio. Here's what you need to begin:

- A non-slip surface (yoga mat preferred, but carpet works)
- Comfortable clothing that allows movement
- Enough space to extend your arms and legs
- 15-30 minutes of uninterrupted time

Start with just 10-15 minutes a day. Consistency matters more than duration. Move slowly, breathe deeply, and be patient with yourself.

Welcome to the journey.
