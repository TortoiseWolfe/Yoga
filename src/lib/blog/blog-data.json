Mountain Pose (Tadasana)\n\n**Category:** Standing, Foundation\n\n![Mountain Pose (Tadasana) - Standing straight with arms at sides](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/01-mountain-pose.png)\n\nMountain Pose might look like \"just standing,\" but it's the foundation for all standing poses. This is where you learn to find your center and establish proper alignment.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart, whichever feels more stable\n2. Distribute your weight evenly across all four corners of each foot\n3. Engage your thighs slightly, lifting your kneecaps without locking\n4. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor\n5. Roll your shoulders back and down, away from your ears\n6. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides, palms facing forward or toward your thighs\n7. Lengthen through the crown of your head as if a string is pulling you upward\n8. Soften your jaw, relax your face, breathe naturally\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Ears over shoulders\n- Shoulders over hips\n- Hips over ankles\n- Neutral spine (natural curves maintained)\n- Weight balanced front-to-back and side-to-side\n\n---\n\n## 2. Cat Pose (Marjaryasana)\n\n**Category:** Tabletop, Spinal Flexion\n\n![Cat Pose (Marjaryasana) - On hands and knees with spine rounded upward](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/02-cat-pose.png)\n\nCat Pose pairs with Cow Pose to create a gentle spinal warm-up. This flexion movement releases tension in the back and neck.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Come to hands and knees, wrists under shoulders, knees under hips\n2. Spread your fingers wide, press evenly through your palms\n3. As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling\n4. Tuck your tailbone under, drawing your pubic bone forward\n5. Let your head drop naturally, gaze toward your navel\n6. Press the floor away, feeling the stretch between your shoulder blades\n7. Imagine you're a cat arching its back\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Wrists directly below shoulders\n- Knees directly below hips\n- Spine in full flexion (rounded upward)\n- Head relaxed, not forced down\n- Equal weight in both hands and both knees\n\n---\n\n## 3. Cow Pose (Bitilasana)\n\n**Category:** Tabletop, Spinal Extension\n\n![Cow Pose (Bitilasana) - On hands and knees with belly dropped and chest lifted](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/03-cow-pose.png)\n\nCow Pose is the counterpart to Cat Pose. Together, they create a flowing movement that warms up the entire spine.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. From your tabletop position, as you inhale, drop your belly toward the mat\n2. Lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling\n3. Let your belly release and soften\n4. Draw your shoulders back, away from your ears\n5. Lift your gaze gently, looking forward or slightly up\n6. Keep your neck as a natural extension of your spine—don't crunch it\n7. Feel the stretch across your chest and the front of your torso\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Wrists still under shoulders\n- Knees still under hips\n- Spine in extension (belly dropping, chest lifting)\n- Shoulders drawing back (not hunching)\n- Neck follows spine's curve naturally\n\n### Cat-Cow Flow\n\nMove between Cat and Cow with your breath: inhale into Cow, exhale into Cat. Repeat 5-10 times to warm up your spine.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Child's Pose (Balasana)\n\n**Category:** Resting, Forward Fold\n\n![Child's Pose (Balasana) - Kneeling with forehead on mat and arms extended](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/04-childs-pose.png)\n\nChild's Pose is your home base—a restful position you can return to whenever you need a break. It gently stretches the back while calming the nervous system.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. From hands and knees, bring your big toes together and widen your knees\n2. Sink your hips back toward your heels\n3. Walk your hands forward, lowering your chest toward the mat\n4. Rest your forehead on the mat\n5. Let your arms extend forward, palms down, or bring them alongside your body\n6. Release all tension in your shoulders, letting them melt toward the floor\n7. Breathe deeply into your back body, feeling your ribs expand\n8. Stay here as long as you need—this is your resting pose\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Hips reaching toward heels (they don't have to touch)\n- Forehead resting (use a block if it doesn't reach the floor)\n- Shoulders relaxed, not hunched\n- Breathing is easy and unrestricted\n\n### Modifications\n\n- **Knees too tight?** Keep knees closer together\n- **Forehead doesn't reach?** Stack your fists or use a yoga block\n- **Ankles uncomfortable?** Place a rolled blanket under them\n\n---\n\n## 5. Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)\n\n**Category:** Standing/Inversion, Full Body\n\n![Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) - Inverted V-shape with hands and feet on mat](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/05-downward-dog.png)\n\nDownward Dog is one of the most recognizable yoga poses. It stretches the entire back body while building upper body strength.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. From hands and knees, tuck your toes under\n2. Press into your hands and lift your knees off the floor\n3. Send your hips up and back, straightening your legs as much as comfortable\n4. Your body forms an inverted V-shape or triangle\n5. Spread your fingers wide, press through the whole hand, especially the knuckle mounds\n6. Let your head hang naturally between your upper arms\n7. Draw your shoulder blades down your back, away from your ears\n8. Reach your heels toward the floor—they don't need to touch\n9. Pedal your feet if that feels good, warming up the backs of your legs\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Hands shoulder-width apart, feet hip-width apart\n- Spine is straight (not rounded or overly arched)\n- Weight distributed between hands and feet\n- Head relaxed, not looking forward\n- Slight bend in knees is fine to maintain straight spine\n\n### Modifications\n\n- **Tight hamstrings?** Keep your knees bent—a straight spine is more important than straight legs\n- **Wrist pain?** Try making fists or using yoga wedges under your palms\n\n---\n\n## 6. Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I)\n\n**Category:** Standing, Strength\n\n![Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I) - Lunge position with arms reaching overhead](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/06-warrior-i.png)\n\nWarrior I builds heat and strength while opening the hips and chest. It's a powerful pose that demands both strength and focus.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. From standing, step one foot back about 3-4 feet\n2. Turn your back foot out about 45 degrees, front foot points forward\n3. Bend your front knee, aiming to stack it over your ankle\n4. Try to square your hips toward the front of your mat\n5. Inhale and sweep your arms overhead, palms facing each other or touching\n6. Draw your shoulders down away from your ears\n7. Engage your back leg, pressing through the outer edge of your back foot\n8. Lift through your chest, creating length in your spine\n9. Gaze forward or slightly up toward your hands\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Front knee tracks over front ankle (not past toes)\n- Front knee points same direction as front toes\n- Back leg is straight and strong\n- Hips squared forward as much as possible\n- Ribcage not flaring out\n- Arms active, reaching up\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n- Letting the front knee collapse inward\n- Overarching the lower back\n- Shrugging shoulders toward ears\n\n---\n\n## 7. Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II)\n\n**Category:** Standing, Strength\n\n![Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II) - Wide stance with arms extended horizontally](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/07-warrior-ii.png)\n\nWarrior II opens the body to the side, creating a powerful stance that builds leg strength and hip flexibility.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. From Warrior I, open your hips and torso to the side of your mat\n2. Extend your arms out to the sides, parallel to the floor\n3. Your front arm reaches forward, back arm reaches back\n4. Keep your front knee bent, tracking over your ankle\n5. Press into the outer edge of your back foot\n6. Stack your shoulders directly over your hips\n7. Engage your core, lengthening your tailbone down\n8. Turn your head to gaze over your front fingertips\n9. Arms are active—imagine you're being pulled in both directions\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Hips and torso face the side (not front)\n- Front knee still bent, over ankle\n- Arms create one straight line, parallel to floor\n- Shoulders relaxed down\n- Gaze over front hand\n- Back foot at 90 degrees to front foot\n\n---\n\n## 8. Tree Pose (Vrksasana)\n\n**Category:** Standing, Balance\n\n![Tree Pose (Vrksasana) - Standing on one leg with arms overhead](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/08-tree-pose.png)\n\nTree Pose develops balance and concentration. It's a reminder that wobbling is part of the practice—trees sway in the wind!\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Begin in Mountain Pose, find a focal point (drishti) to gaze at\n2. Shift your weight into your left foot, rooting down through all four corners\n3. Lift your right foot and place it on your inner left thigh or calf\n4. **Never place your foot on your knee—above or below only**\n5. Press your foot into your leg and your leg back into your foot\n6. Bring your hands to heart center, or extend them overhead\n7. Keep your standing hip from jutting out—stay centered\n8. Lengthen through your spine, crown of head reaching up\n9. Breathe steadily—wobbling is normal and part of the practice\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Standing foot firmly grounded\n- Bent knee opens to the side (not forward)\n- Hips stay level (not tilting)\n- Spine straight and tall\n- Shoulders relaxed\n- Core engaged for stability\n\n### Modifications\n\n- **Struggling with balance?** Keep your toes on the ground, heel against your ankle\n- **Need more challenge?** Close your eyes (carefully!)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)\n\n**Category:** Prone, Backbend\n\n![Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana) - Lying prone with chest lifted and arms supporting](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/09-cobra-pose.png)\n\nCobra Pose is a gentle backbend that strengthens the back muscles while opening the chest. It's more subtle than it looks—resist the urge to push too high.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Lie face down on your mat, legs extended behind you, tops of feet on the floor\n2. Place your hands under your shoulders, elbows close to your body\n3. Press the tops of your feet and thighs into the mat\n4. On an inhale, begin to lift your chest off the floor\n5. Use your back muscles, not just your arms, to lift\n6. Keep your elbows slightly bent and hugged in\n7. Draw your shoulders back and down, opening your chest\n8. Keep your gaze forward or slightly upward—don't crunch your neck\n9. Keep your pubic bone on the mat—this isn't a full backbend\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Pubic bone and legs stay grounded\n- Elbows stay bent, close to body\n- Shoulders away from ears\n- Chest lifts, but lower ribs can stay on mat\n- Neck is long extension of spine\n- No compression in lower back\n\n---\n\n## 10.

It's calming and introspective, helping to quiet the mind.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Sit with your legs extended straight in front of you\n2. Flex your feet, toes pointing up toward the ceiling\n3. Sit up tall, lengthening your spine\n4. Inhale and reach your arms overhead\n5. Exhale and hinge forward from your hips—not your waist\n6. Lead with your chest, keeping your spine as long as possible\n7. Reach for your shins, ankles, or feet—wherever you can comfortably hold\n8. Let your head and neck relax\n9. With each inhale, lengthen; with each exhale, fold a little deeper\n10. It's not about touching your toes—it's about lengthening the spine\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Sitting bones grounded\n- Legs active, kneecaps pointing up\n- Folding from hips, not rounding from lower back\n- Spine stays long as possible\n- Shoulders relaxed, not hunching\n- Breath remains steady\n\n### Modifications\n\n- **Tight hamstrings?** Sit on a folded blanket and/or bend your knees\n- **Can't reach your feet?** Use a strap around your feet\n\n---\n\n## 11. Bridge Pose (Setu Bandhasana)\n\n**Category:** Supine, Backbend\n\n![Bridge Pose (Setu Bandhasana) - Lying on back with hips lifted toward ceiling](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/11-bridge-pose.png)\n\nBridge Pose opens the front body and strengthens the back. It's a gentle inversion that can be both energizing and restorative.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor hip-width apart\n2. Place your feet close enough that you can touch your heels with your fingertips\n3. Arms rest alongside your body, palms facing down\n4. Press your feet into the floor\n5. On an inhale, lift your hips toward the ceiling\n6. Roll your spine off the mat one vertebra at a time\n7. Press your arms into the mat for support\n8. Keep your thighs parallel—don't let knees splay outward\n9. Lift your chest toward your chin, but don't move your chin\n10. Keep your neck relaxed—don't turn your head in this pose\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Feet parallel, hip-width apart\n- Knees track over ankles\n- Weight in feet, not neck\n- Thighs stay parallel\n- Chest lifts toward chin (chin stays neutral)\n- Shoulders grounded, neck long\n\n---\n\n## 12. Corpse Pose (Savasana)\n\n**Category:** Supine, Restoration\n\n![Corpse Pose (Savasana) - Lying flat on back in complete relaxation](/blog-images/beginner-yoga-poses/12-corpse-pose.png)\n\nCorpse Pose is the final relaxation. Despite appearing simple, many consider it the most important—and most challenging—pose. It's where the benefits of your practice integrate.\n\n### How to Practice\n\n1. Lie flat on your back\n2. Let your feet fall open naturally, about mat-width apart\n3. Bring your arms alongside your body, slightly away from your torso\n4. Turn your palms to face the ceiling\n5. Tuck your shoulder blades slightly underneath you, opening your chest\n6. Let your lower back release into the mat\n7. Close your eyes\n8. Relax your jaw, let your tongue rest\n9. Soften your forehead, the space between your eyebrows\n10. Let go of any effort. Let the mat hold you completely\n11. Simply breathe and be present\n\n### Alignment Checkpoints\n\n- Entire back body releasing into mat\n- Arms away from body, palms up (receptive)\n- Legs relaxed, feet falling open\n- Head centered, chin slightly tucked\n- Every muscle consciously released\n- Breath natural, not controlled\n\n### Tips for Savasana\n\n- Stay for at least 5 minutes (longer is better)\n- Cover yourself with a blanket if you get cold\n- Place a bolster under your knees if your lower back is uncomfortable\n- If your mind races, focus on the sensation of your breath\n\n---\n\n## Sequencing Principles\n\nWhen you practice, remember these principles:\n\n1. **Start gently:** Begin with centering and gentle warm-ups\n2. **Build heat progressively:** Move from gentle to more demanding poses\n3. **Balance the body:** Follow forward folds with gentle backbends, balance right and left sides\n4. **Include transitions:** Use Downward Dog, Child's Pose, and Mountain as transitions\n5. **Wind down gradually:** Move from active poses to passive ones before final relaxation\n6. **Always end with Savasana:** Allow at least 5 minutes for integration\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility and Modifications\n\nYoga is for every body. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n- **Use props freely:** Blocks, straps, and blankets aren't cheating—they're tools\n- **Listen to your body:** Sharp pain is a signal to back off\n- **Breath is your guide:** If you can't breathe smoothly, ease up\n- **Modify without shame:** Every body is different\n\n### Common Contraindications\n\n- **Lower back issues:** Be cautious with forward folds and backbends\n- **Knee problems:** Avoid deep knee bends, use padding\n- **Neck injuries:** Skip headstand variations, be careful in shoulder stand\n- **Pregnancy:** Many poses need modification—consult a prenatal yoga teacher\n- **High blood pressure:** Avoid inversions and breath retention\n\n---\n\n## Starting Your Practice\n\nYou don't need fancy equipment or a dedicated studio. Here's what you need to begin:\n\n- A non-slip surface (yoga mat preferred, but carpet works)\n- Comfortable clothing that allows movement\n- Enough space to extend your arms and legs\n- 15-30 minutes of uninterrupted time\n\nStart with just 10-15 minutes a day. Consistency matters more than duration. Move slowly, breathe deeply, and be patient with yourself.\n\nWelcome to the journey.\n",
